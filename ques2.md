## Test how much your code changed the execution time for the programs. What do you conclude?

Time taken to exec 2*2 determinant


| FileName  |Time Without Implementation   |Time With Implentation   |
|-----------|--------------|-------------|
| Matrix.h  |0.00027 sec   | 3e-05 sec   |
| Overload.h|0.000276 sec  | 2.5e-05 sec |
| PSMatrix.h|0.000288 sec  | 2.9e-05 sec |

As we can see that there is a time improvement of almost 10 times after implementing the specialized function.
